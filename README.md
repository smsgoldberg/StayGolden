# STAY GOLDEN 

"Stay Golden" was formed from my love of golden retrievers, and fond memories of playing games at my grandparents' houses when I was growing up. This simple matching game challenges the player to uncover the matching pairs of golden retriever photos in under a minute. A win/loss function will maintain a tally of players' respective wins and losses for up to 10 games in a row!
