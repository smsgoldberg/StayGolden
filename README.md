# STAY GOLDEN 

"Stay Golden" was formed from my love of golden retrievers, and fond memories of playing games  at my grandparents' houses when I was growing up. This simple, 2-player matching game asks players to uncover the matching pairs of golden retriever photos. The first player to uncover four matching pairs wins! A timer function ensures that players can't take /too/ long in making their decisions. The game will maintain a tally of players' respective wins for up to 10 games in a row.
